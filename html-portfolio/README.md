# HTML Playground Projects

This folder contains legacy mini HTML/CSS projects originally housed in a separate repo [`html-portfolio`](https://github.com/dhu2022-dev/html-portfolio), based on exercises from the early part of Dr. Angela Yu's Web Development Bootcamp.

These have been moved here for better organization and consolidation.
